conda activate droidenv_clean
created this environment by manually installing all relevant packages, with versioning trial-and-error until it worked (didn't install torch-scatter).

Had to install gcc-10 in home directory and modify setup.py, adding '--compiler-bindir=/home/yajatyadav/opt/gcc-10/bin',
to nvcc, could then succesfully run setup.py install.

After that, had to run 
export CUDA_HOME=/usr/lib/nvidia-cuda-toolkit
export CC=~/opt/gcc-10/bin/gcc
export CXX=~/opt/gcc-10/bin/g++
export CFLAGS="-I$CUDA_HOME/include"
export CXXFLAGS="-I$CUDA_HOME/include"
export TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST="8.6"
export FORCE_CUDA=1
export NVCC_FLAGS="--compiler-bindir=/home/yajatyadav/opt/gcc-10/bin"

before installing torch-scatter



mega-sam: similar story- after installing using the yaml file, python setup.py install will crash, so then need to do:
# Activate your environment
conda activate mega_sam_2

# Install gcc 9 and g++ 9 inside Conda
conda install -c conda-forge gcc_linux-64=9 gxx_linux-64=9

# Tell torch/cpp_extension to use these versions
export CC=$CONDA_PREFIX/bin/x86_64-conda-linux-gnu-gcc
export CXX=$CONDA_PREFIX/bin/x86_64-conda-linux-gnu-g++
